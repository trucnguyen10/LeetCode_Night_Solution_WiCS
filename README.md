# WiCS LeetCode Night Solution Repo

**This repository is created for participants of the WiCS LeetCode night to share their solutions to problems on LeetCode.** Participants of the event are given problems from LeetCode and are encouraged to solve them using any programming language of their choice. The purpose of this event is to help participants practice problem-solving and coding skills, as well as provide an opportunity for participants to collaborate and learn from each other.
